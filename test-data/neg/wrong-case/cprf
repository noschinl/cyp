Lemma: length (xs ++ ys) .=. length xs + length ys

Proof by induction on List xs

Case []

    To show: length ([] ++ ys) .=. length [] + length ys

    Proof
                                 length ([] ++ ys)
        (by def ++)          .=. length ys

                                 length [] + length ys
        (by def length)      .=. 0 + length ys
        (by arith)           .=. length ys

Case x:xs

    To show: length ((x : xs) ++ ys) .=. length (x : xs) + length ys
    IH: length (xs ++ ys) .=. length xs + length ys

    Proof
                                 length ((x:xs) ++ ys)
        (by cheating)        .=. length (x : (xs ++ ys))
        (by def length)      .=. 1 + length (xs ++ ys)
        (by IH)              .=. 1 + (length xs + length ys)

                             length (x:xs) + length ys
        (by def length)      .=. (1 + length xs) + length ys
        (by arith)           .=. 1 + (length xs + length ys)
