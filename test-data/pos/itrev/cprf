Lemma itrev_rev: itrev xs ys .=. reverse xs ++ ys

Proof by induction on List xs

Case [] -- base case

    To show: itrev [] ys .=. reverse [] ++ ys

    Proof
                                itrev [] ys
        (by def itrev)      .=. ys

        reverse [] ++ ys
        (by def reverse)    .=. [] ++ ys
        (by def ++)         .=. ys

Case x:xs  -- induction step

    To show: itrev (x:xs) ys .=. reverse (x:xs) ++ ys
    IH1: itrev xs ys .=. reverse xs ++ ys

    Proof
                                itrev (x:xs) ys
        (by def itrev)      .=. itrev xs (x:ys)
        (by IH1)            .=. reverse xs ++ (x:ys)
